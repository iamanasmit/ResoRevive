Here I built a simple ANN architecture using tensorflow <br/>
For this I referred to CampuX Deep Learning playlist https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKnIA16_RmvYuZauWaPlRTC54KxSNLtNn
<br/>
In the second checkpoint I used transfer learning to create a leaf disease classifier. I used the Xception model for this purpose. The accuracy comes out to be much higher than that achieved by ResNET model.
<br/>
In the 7th and 8th week, I studied GANs and tried to implement architectures of them. Due to computational constraints i was not able to completely train them but in the future i look to build complete projects involving GANs and train them using cloud services.
